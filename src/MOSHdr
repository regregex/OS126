DOGOIO *        &FF
; ($00 => TRUE,  $FF => FALSE)

; special labels for DOGOIO
SEAL   *        &DC
;The value to be returned in A by OSARGS A=1, Y=0
;when trapped by MOS/CFS/RFS.
;MSRM says to preserve A (p. H.3-5), i.e. A=1
;however MOS 3.20 breaks the spec and returns A=&DC, mostly.
;This is just a copy of the 3MSB of the pointer at X+1.
;NAUG says A is undefined (p.253); other unofficial sources
;suggest that implemented OSARGS calls *should not*
;preserve A.

MAGIC  *        &FF
;Number of a page in the address space that will never
;contain a command line.  Used as a sentinel value
;to indicate when OSARGS 1 should be passed on to the FS.
;Now that the BooBip OS RAM module exists, page &FF is the
;most reliable choice.

TAILLO *        &02D0
TAILHI *        &02D1
;Locations to store the command line tail pointer from *GO
;and *RUN. Need not be adjacent.  Formerly buffer activity
;flags that are free in OS 1.26.
